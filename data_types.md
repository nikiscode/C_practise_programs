 //Data Types in C
Data types specify the type of data that a variable can store.
1. Basic Data Types
Used to store simple values.
Examples: int, char, float, double
2. Derived Data Types
Derived from basic data types.
Examples: arrays, pointers, functions
3. User Defined Data Types
Created by the programmer.
Examples: structure, union, enum
4. Void Data Type
Represents no value or empty type.
Used in functions that do not return a value.
Size of Data Types
int → used for integers
char → used for characters
float → used for decimal numbers
double → used for large decimal numbers
(Note: size depends on compiler and system)
Why Data Types are Important
Allocate proper memory
Improve program efficiency
Avoid type mismatch errors
